# Egyptian League Management System (C++ CLI Project)

This is a simple command-line program built in C++ to manage football teams and players in the Egyptian League. It allows users to add, search, update, and delete teams and players using a basic menu-driven interface. The system handles data using custom linked lists without relying on the STL.

This was a **group project** developed as part of a university course. I contributed to the design, implementation, and debugging of several core features, including player and team management functions.
